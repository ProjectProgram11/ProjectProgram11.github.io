            <p>I chose these five quotes because I found them all to be very iconic and inspirational. For example, I chose the first and last quotes, "This meeting can do nothing more to save the country!", and "Give me liberty, or give me death", to me they show just how much the colonists were unable to accept this unfair treatment. I also chose the third and fourth quotes, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.", and "No taxation without representation.", because they are both, in my opinion, the most well-known quotes of the American Revolution. These five quotes impacted my view of American Independence because, seeing all of the different quotes and people who impacted the revolution while I was doing research, made me think of how many people had to come together and work together for the revolution to be successful, I had already heard these quotes before but I hadn't learned of the people behind them, these quotes also showed me how these people were willing to die and sacrifice everything for there cause.</p>

            <p>I chose the five pictures because I think each of those types of each of those types of paintings and photos are important to Americas history and they represent the things we did to get where we are. An example of this is the painting of the Second Coninental Congress. I chose this painting because it represented all of the planning and strategy that went in to the revolution and creating a government that we don't learn about in school. I chose the paintings of battle because they showed the sacrifices people made. I chose the photo of the Proclamation Act of 1763 because it was an early action that triggered a lot of colonists.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I chose those five vocabulary words for a few different reasons. For monopoly, I chose it because it is relevant to the American Revolution as it was one of the actions that the British took that aggrevated the colonists, they created a monopoly. I chose Loyalist and Patriot because they were the two main sides of the colonists. I chose Minutemen because in my opinion, it is the local militia and Minutemen soldiers that aren't recognized for helping even though they did the work. I chose mercenary because hired soldiers and spies are a key part of any war.</p>
